1. I use the Gemini Ai for web crawling/scrapping
2. Sensitive data is being secured in the ENV files
3. I use the cheerio to load the data from the website and use it like as Content
4. Render- https://web-crawler-6kqp.onrender.com
5. If you want to see the analytics of the AI, go to postman and search this: https://web-crawler-6kqp.onrender.com/api/analytics

Frontend: (REACT)
1. I use the React for frontend part because of SPA
